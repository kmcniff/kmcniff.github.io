	<h2>The weekend</h2>

		<p>The southern Maine coast is a destination in itself. Many friends and family are staying for the weekend and exploring York, Kennebunkport and Wells, or hanging out a little south in Portsmouth, NH. We have some suggested sites for you the things to see section below.</p>

	<h2>Where to stay</h2>

		<p>Union Bluff meeting House is part of the larger Union Bluff Hotel, with two building options, and many pricing levels. 

		<p>Additionally, there are a few other small hotels. We recommend you stay as close as possible, as Cape Neddick is very small and walkable, and there will be no transportation provided at the wedding.</p>

		<p>If you find accommodations farther than walking distance away, we can provide you with transportation options for reception night, including uber and are taxi companies.</p>  

	<h2>Our wedding entourage</h2>

		<p> Admittedly, our wedding entourage is way cooler than we are. But hey, you are who you surround yourself with!</p>

		<h3>Her side</h3>

		<p>We met on the dating site farmersonly.com. Neither one of us farm, but we like the idea. I didn’t admit I wasn’t actually a farmer until our third date. Then he came clean as well. It turns out it worked out for the best as we both prefer living in the city.</p>
